## About KWDB

**KWDB is a distributed multi-model database designed for AIoT scenarios and incubated by the OpenAtom Foundation**.​​ Originating from Inspur's KaiwuDB project, it supports the concurrent creation of time-series and relational databases within the same instance and the integrated processing of multi-model data. KWDB can process time-series data with high efficiency. It supports tens of millions of device connections, millions of data points written per second, and hundreds of millions of data points read per second. It features stability & security, high availability, and easy maintenance.

**It is mainly used in fields such as IoT, energy, power, IoV (Internet of Vehicles), smart government, IT operation management, and securities.**  KWDB is dedicated to offer a comprehensive platform for data storage, management, and analysis across various industries, supporting enterprises in their digital transformation and unlocking greater value from their data at lower costs.

## Quick Start

You can quickly experience KWDB using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --privileged --name kwdb \
  -p 26257:26257 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /var/lib/kaiwudb:/kaiwudb/deploy/kaiwudb-container \
  --ipc shareable \
  -w /kaiwudb/bin \
  kwdb/kwdb \
  ./kwbase start-single-node \
    --insecure \
    --listen-addr=0.0.0.0:26257 \
    --http-addr=0.0.0.0:8080 \
    --store=/kaiwudb/deploy/kaiwudb-container
```

kwbase is a built-in CLI tool provided by KWDB. Users can use kwbase to connect to KaiwuDB and perform database operations and maintenance.

Use Docker to connect to KWDB and start an interactive SQL Shell:

```bash
docker exec -it kwdb./kwbase sql --insecure --host=127.0.0.1
```

### Environment Preparation

1. Download and extract [the CMake installation package](https://cmake.org/download/).

   ```Bash
   tar -C /usr/local/ -xvf cmake-3.23.4-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   mv /usr/local/cmake-3.23.4-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/cmake
   ```

2. Download and extract [the Go installation package](https://golang.google.cn/dl/).

   ```Bash
   tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.22.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

3. Create a directory for the project.

   ```Bash
   mkdir -p /home/go/src/gitee.com
   ```

4. Set environment variables for Go and CMake.

   - Individual users: Modify the `~/.bashrc` file.

   - System-wide settings (root permissions needed): Modify the `/etc/profile` file.

      ```Bash
      export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
      export GOPATH=/home/go      # here using /home/go as an example
      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/cmake/bin
      ```

5. Apply the environment variable settings:

   - Individual users:

      ```Shell
      source ~/.bashrc                           
      ```

   - System-wide settings:

      ```Shell
      source /etc/profile                           
      ```

### Downloading Code

Download the code from the [KWDB code repository](https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb) and store it in the directory declared by `GOPATH`.

- Use `git` commands:

   ```Bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/kwdb/kwdb.git /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb # Do not modify src/gitee.com/kwbasedb in the directory path.
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb
   git submodule update --init  # For the first-time code pull
   git submodule update --remote
   ```

- Download the code archive and extract it to the specified directory.

### Building and Installing

1. Create and change to the build directory in the project directory.

   ```Bash
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Run the CMake command.

   ```Bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release | Debug ]
   ```

   `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: the build type. The default is `Debug`. Optional values include `Debug` and `Release`, with the initial letter capitalized.

3. Disable Go modules.

   1. Set the environment variable.

      - Individual users: Modify the `~/.bashrc` file.

      - System-wide settings (requires root permissions): Modify the `/etc/profile` file.

         ```Shell
         export GO111MODULE=off         
         ```

   2. Apply the environment variable settings:

      - Individual users:

        ```Shell
        source ~/.bashrc         
        ```

      - System-wide settings:

        ```Shell
        source /etc/profile 
        ```

4. Compile and install the project.

   > **Note:**
   > - If there is an error due to legacy protobuf autogenerated files during code compilation, use `make clean` to clean the build directory.
   > - If you need to specify the protobuf file path, use `make PROTOBUF_DIR=<protobuf_directory>`.

   ```Shell
   make      
   make install      
   ```

   The file list after successful compilation and installation is as follows:

   ```Plain
   /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb
   ├── install
   │   ├── bin
   │   │   ├── err_inject.sh
   │   │   ├── query_kwbase_status.sh
   │   │   ├── query_status.sh
   │   │   ├── setup_cert_file.sh
   │   │   ├── utils.sh
   │   │   └── kwbase
   │   └── lib
   │       ├── libcommon.so
   │       └── libkwdbts2.so
   ```

5. (Optional) In the directory where the `kwbase` script is located, check the database version to verify if the installation is successful.

   ```Bash
   ./kwbase version
   ```

   Example output:

   ```Plain
   KaiwuDB Version:  V2.0.3.2_RC3-3-gfe5eeb853e-dirty
   Build Time:       2024/07/19 06:24:00
   Distribution:
   Platform:         linux amd64 (x86_64-linux-gnu)
   Go Version:       go1.22.5
   C Compiler:       gcc 11.4.0
   Build SHA-1:      fe5eeb853e0884a963fd43b380a0b0057f88fb19
   ```

### Starting the Database

1. Switch to the directory where the `kwbase` script is located.

   ```Bash
   cd /home/go/src/gitee.com/kwbasedb/install/bin
   ```

2. Set the search path for shared libraries.

   ```Bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib
   ```

3. Start the database.

   ```Bash
   ./kwbase start-single-node --insecure --listen-addr=:26257 --background
   ```

4. After the database starts, you can connect and use it via the kwbase CLI tool, KaiwuDB Developer Center, or connectors like the KaiwuDB JDBC driver.
